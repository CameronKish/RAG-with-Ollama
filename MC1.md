If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. P41

- The fact that we are able to see something to even have some or no meaning at all shows that there must be a meaning, or we wouldn’t be able to understand what meaning is to begin with. God gave us a mind to think, and an eternal soul that longs for more. Surely we wouldn’t be satisfied with the temporary things of earth. In our hearts we know there’s got to be something more. It cant all end at death right?

- Romans 8:28; And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.

- Colossians 3:23-24; Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.
